VITE_CRICKET_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# Note: After getting your API key, copy this file to create a new file named '.env'
# with your actual API key. The .env file will not be committed to git (it's in .gitignore).

# Example:
# VITE_CRICKET_API_KEY=abc123def456ghi789

# If you encounter venue-related errors, make sure your API key is valid and
# has permission to access cricket venue data.

# *** OPEN SOURCE API OPTION ***
# If you don't want to sign up for a Cricket Data API key, you can leave the VITE_CRICKET_API_KEY
# empty or remove it completely. The app will automatically use an open source cricket API instead.
# Note that the open source API may have limited data compared to the official API.
#
# Example for using open source API:
# VITE_CRICKET_API_KEY=
